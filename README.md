# node-red-http-examples #

This collection of HTTP(S)-related [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) examples (with matching [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) Collections for testing) is mainly intended for my students, but parts of it might also be of more general interest

### Recommended Extensions ###

* node-red-contrib-components
